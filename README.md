# DarkBark

That‚Äôs DarkBark. Dark, quiet, confident, like a rainy-night synthwave playlist for your CLI. The colors? Handpicked with the kind of care usually reserved for painting tiny Warhammer figures or rearranging your IDE settings at 2am. It‚Äôs bold when it needs to be (hi there, coral-red errors), calm where it counts (muted blues and foggy greys), and just punchy enough to make tests pop without screaming for attention.

It‚Äôs a design-first terminal theme that actually feels designed, but doesn‚Äôt get in your way. Everything‚Äôs legible. Passes feel like small wins. Fails are still fails, but at least they look decent doing it.


## Theme Demo

Here‚Äôs DarkBark in action, running unit tests with [MaplePHP Unitary](https://github.com/maplephp/unitary):

## Font Family

DarkBark pairs beautifully with `SF Mono`.  The font is in the src directory.
